This [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com) module allows you to use your world's homebrew currencies in D&D 5th Edition. It is forked from cstby's [World Currency 5e](https://github.com/cstby/foundryvtt-world-currency-5e) module and updated to work with the newest versions of Foundry and the dnd5e module.

## Installation

1. On Foundry's "Add-on Modules" tab, click "Install Module"
2. At the bottom, paste `https://github.com/cAPKck/world-currency-5e/releases/latest/download/module.json` into the "Manifest URL" field and click "install".

## Features

### Rename Currency

Rename currencies and their abbreviations. The new names and abbreviations will be used wherever the old names appeared.

### Hide Currency

Hide currencies that you don't want to use. If your players get confused by platinum and electrum, hide them and never think of them again!

### Hide Converter

If your currencies aren't meant to be interchangeable, you can hide the currency converter from the character sheets.

### Set Conversion Rates

Set whatever currency rates you need. Great for using the silver standard, which makes gold more rare.

## Compatibility

World Currencies 5e works by patching the currency names and rates set by the D&D 5e System. Any module that pulls names and rates from the D&D 5e System will display them correctly.

| **Name** | Works | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [D&D 5e System](https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e) | :heavy_check_mark: | Fully Compatible |
| [Item Piles for D&D 5e](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-ItemPilesDND5e) | :heavy_check_mark: | If installed, a button is added to sync settings |
| [Tidy 5e Sheets](https://github.com/kgar/foundry-vtt-tidy-5e-sheets) | :heavy_check_mark: | Should be working out of the box |
